    "\n",
    "After the 1929 Stock Market Crash, thousands of Americans were in danger of home foreclosure. To address this problem and stabilize the market, The Home Owners Loan Coperation (HOLC) was created under the Rooselvelt Administration to asses credibility of families in order to decide to refinance their homes.\n",
    " \n",
    "The HOLC created area descriptions and maps to \"grade\" neighborhoods based on racial/ethnic presence, the income of the residents, and environmental factors to determine their \"financial risk\". A grade of an 'A' (red) , was given to an area characterized as undesirable due to detrimental influences and unfavorable infiltration. Grade 'B' (yellow) areas were characterized by infiltration of a \"lower grade population\", \"lacking homogeniety\", and age of the neighborhoods, grade 'C' (blue) areas were completely developed, and 'grade 'D' (green) areas were characterized as \"hot spots\" that weren't fully built up yet and contained homogeinety. This is called __*redlining*__, denying financial services based on race/ethnic background.\n",
